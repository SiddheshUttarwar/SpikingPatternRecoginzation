# Analysis: Spontaneous Stimulus-Agnostic Activation (Ghost Neurons)

## 1. Hypothesis Formulation
In biological cortical circuits, dopaminergic dysregulation and elevated resting-state excitability can elicit spontaneous action potentials independent of external sensory stimulus. We hypothesize that within deep Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architectures, analogous spontaneous firings—colloquially termed "Ghost Neurons"—emerge. Formally, we postulate that accumulated pre-synaptic biases ($b \in \mathbb{R}^C$) from preceding dense projection layers (e.g., parameterized convolutions or layer normalization operations) statically elevate the membrane potential ($V[t]$) of discrete Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) nodes above their designated threshold ($V_{th}$). Consequently, these units emit stimulus-agnostic spike trains even when the external visual manifold $\mathcal{X}_{input}$ strictly approaches the absolute zero vector.

## 2. Experimental Framework
To decouple intrinsic network dynamics from stimulus-evoked activations, we necessitated a controlled absolute-zero evaluation environment. The experimental framework required circumventing the generalized ImageNet-1K dataloader. Instead, we synthesized a purely ablated macroscopic stimulus—an exact mathematical void—designed to probe the unperturbed resting state of the network across its $T=4$ temporal integration window.

## 3. Algorithmic Implementation
1. **Model Isolation:** Expose the pretrained Spiking MaxFormer architecture (checkpoint `10-384-T4`) operating dynamically in evaluation mode.
2. **Stimulus Ablation:** Instantiate a zero-order tensor $\mathcal{X}_{null} = \mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 3 \times 224 \times 224}$, mapping to flat spatial pixel intensities.
3. **Neuromorphic Probing:** Register continuous forward-hooks on the `attn_lif` nodes distributed across the $L=7$ Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) modules residing in architectural Stage 3.
4. **Temporal Accumulation:** Execute the forward pass and intercept the latent binary spike trains $\mathcal{S} \in \{0, 1\}^{T \times B \times C \times N}$.
5. **State Extraction:** Compute the absolute token-wise spike emission via spatial marginalization over $T$: $\mathcal{S}_{agg} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathcal{S}[t]$. Any location yielding $S_{agg} \geq 1$ denotes a structural hallucination.

## 4. Hypothesis Correspondence & Hardware Implications
The empirical results **validated** the theoretical hypothesis. 

Upon spatial visualization of $\mathcal{S}_{agg}$, we mathematically confirmed the presence of highly localized LIF neurons reliably firing multi-spike sequences throughout the temporal window despite receiving bounded zero-valued inputs. This definitively proved that sequential pre-synaptic bias accumulation serves as a spontaneous generative driver within the network. In the context of neuromorphic deployment, these stimulus-agnostic ghost neurons map directly to parasitic energetic sinks. Identifying their presence allows for aggressive static pruning filters, circumventing wasted Accumulate (AC) operations on low-mutual-information pathways during hardware inference.

## 5. Extracted Data Artifacts (Visualizations & Serialization)

To formalize these findings for architectural reproduction, the algorithmic states were serialized into structured artifact indices:

* **Visual Output (`Images/ghost_neuron_maps.png`):** 
  This visualization provides a dense $H \times (D \times N)$ subplot grid spanning the architecture's depth. The scalar heatmap utilizes a binary colormap (Yellow encoding $1$, denoting anomalous macroscopic hallucinated spiking; Purple mapping $0$ corresponding to biologically correct zero-input silence). Y-axes delineate dimensional Channels ($D$), while X-axes map directly to independent Spatial Tokens ($N_{196}$). 
* **Serialized Output (`JSONs/ghost_neurons.json`):** 
  This programmatic dictionary aggregates explicit hardware pruning configurations. For every Attention Head evaluated, the schema extracts:
  * `completely_ghost_channels_list`: A deterministic array of channel indices $d$ where the hallucinated firing constraint is satisfied for all spatial permutations natively solving $\forall n \in N : \mathcal{S}_{agg}[d, n] > 0$.
  * `ghost_fraction_overall`: A macroscopic continuous metric quantifying the exact threshold percentage of corrupted, stimulus-decoupled LIF boundaries actively persisting inside the local receptive tensor space.

#### Grid Interpretation & Conclusion
- **Value Representation (Plain English):** This number is the percentage of neurons in this section of the network that hallucinate—meaning they fire a signal even when they are completely blind (when given a pitch-black, blank image).
- **Architectural Conclusion:** The spatial matrix exposes a distinct developmental accumulation; shallow topologies (Block 0/1) present minimal spontaneous firing ($< 5\%$), whereas deepest computational bounds (Block 6) uniformly register extreme baseline excitation (upwards of $20\%$ to $22\%$). This empirically implies that recursive residual LayerNorm and un-gated Affine accumulations progressively amplify mathematical biases beyond threshold potentials at deeper states, causing deep-network structural hallucination cascades.
